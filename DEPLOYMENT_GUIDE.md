### For You (Technical Setup):

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign up/login
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository OR drag & drop your project folder
4. Vercel will automatically detect it's a Next.js project
5. Click "Deploy" - it takes about 2 minutes
6. You'll get a live URL like: `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`

### For Your Boss (Non-Technical):

- Just send them the live URL
- They can click and use it immediately in any browser
- No installation or technical knowledge required

## Option 2: Local Zip Package (Backup Option)

### What's Included:

- Pre-built application files
- Simple start script
- All dependencies included

### For Your Boss:

1. Download the zip file
2. Extract it to any folder
3. Double-click "START_DEMO.bat" (Windows) or "START_DEMO.command" (Mac)
4. Open browser to http://localhost:3000
